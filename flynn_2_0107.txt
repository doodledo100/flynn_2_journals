1. Given a unique file type, e.g. a 'blorb', how could we identify its file header and tail?
   Hex dump (xxd) the file in question and pipe t he output through head to find the header and vice versa pipe the ouput through tail for the ending.
   Please look at the image df_0106.img in /usr/share/digitalforensics/images.
   Using this image, answer the following questions:
2. Use the command:
3. icat df_0106.img
4. blkls df_0106.img > blkls.df0107
5. strings -t d blkls.df0107 > df0101.str
6. What were the contents of the deleted file?
   Contained passwords and other sensitive information.
7. Use strings or any other tool to find the text contents of another hidden file
