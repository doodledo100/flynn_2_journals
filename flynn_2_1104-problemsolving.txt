At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.

For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?
It does describe me, when I go home, I work with my Linux lab as well as learn how to get them all networked together.

Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?
I would say that I enjoy working independently because I can focus and get the tasks done quickly.
Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not?
Yes I have finished my disk image and will be emailing it to you and uploading it to github.
