Using the commands from yesterday:
pffexport outlook.pst

from the recovered pst file

ls the newly created directory

How many directories are there? What are the directories?
There are lots of directories (five); IPM_COMMON_VIEWS, IPM_VIEWS, Reminders, Search Root, Top of Personal Folders

Using cat , Where are the actual messages kept? What directory(s)? What files?
There are messages in the Inbox, Sent Items, Outbox, and the Deleted Items directories; Calendar, Deleted Items, Inbox, Notes, Sent Items, Contacts, Drafts, Journal, Outbox, Tasks; Messages are kept in .txt or .html file named Message.txt and Message.html respectively.

cat and grep the files to find the email requesting the spreadsheet.
~/Desktop/outlook2.pst.export/Top of Personal Folders$ find | grep "m57biz"
./Sent Items/Message00016/Attachments/1_m57biz.xls
This is how I found the spreadsheet.

Is this email suspicious/problematic? How? Be specific. Explain what most likely happened.
One thing that looks suspicious is that Indy's SSN is 123-45-6789
