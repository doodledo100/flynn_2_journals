I had Ian Jackobson's disk image with the deleted image and text file.
In the steps to recovering his data, I utilized photorec and grep to retrieve the once 'deleted' data.
When I opened the disk image in photorec, it prompted me to select a partition to recover and I selected to search the whole disk.
Then once photorec had recovered the data it output it into the recovered folder I had created prior to recovery.
I opened both PNG files recovered from the disk and found two messages reading, "Hello Mr.Davis", and "Hello I am good".
After I opened the images, I searched the disk using the command "grep -abi "[a-z]*" <iansdiskimagename>.img" in order to find the deleted text file on the disk image.
I found the deleted text message on the disk which read "Mr. Davis Mac is BETTER!"
