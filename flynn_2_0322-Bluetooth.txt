What is Bluetooth?

Yesterday, you should have written a journal describing how a network was compromised and how you solved the crime. Did you mention Bluetooth? Why or why not?

    What do the following tools do? And what is a sample command for each?
    hciconfig
    hcitool
    hcidump

Run apt-cache search bluetooth |less - What are three interesting packages you see? How are they interesting?
