Yesterday, you (should have) successfully got wireless working with the dongle.
After your device shows up:
iwlist ra0 scan
What did you see?
Now try: iwconfig ra0 channel 6 What did you see?
Now iwspy ra0 What was the output? What did it show?
Now in a terminal in Kali: wget "https://www.fingbox.com/download?plat=lx64&ext=deb"
What did this command do?
Then: mv download\?plat\=lx64\&ext\=deb fing.deb Then type ls -rt.
dpkg -i find.deb What did this command accomplish?
How is fing different than iwlist?
Now try: dumpcap -i ra0 -I -L What do you see?
Now try: tshark -i ra0 -I -L What do you see?
Now try: wireshark -i ra0 -I -L What do you see?
