    1. What is the bandwidth of wifi?
    2.4 GHz
    2. What channels does wifi have?
    1-13 but the US only uses 1-11
    3. Which channels do people commonly use? Why?
    1 and 11 because they are on the end of the channel spectrum which means that the other channels that overlap would only happen on one side of the first or last channel, resulting in less interfearance with other channels.
    What are the differences between A, B, G, N, and AC IEEE defined wireless protocols?

    4. What are WEP, WPA, and WPA2? What are the differences?
