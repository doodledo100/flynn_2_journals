What is data carving?
Data carving is a forensic recovery technique for 'carving'  blocks out of raw sectors.
How is it done?
Raw sectors related to a file is searched for info, but the file cannot be fragmented because there is not any allocation information.
How does it relate to what we were doing yesterday?
We were mounting disk images and using offsets to mount the correct part of the disk image.
