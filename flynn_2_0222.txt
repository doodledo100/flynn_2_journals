In your VM

    Execute the command apt-cache search sniff
    What do you see?
    It's a list of tools with the word "sniff" in the names and desc.
    Copy and paste 3 names that sound intersting
    wireshark
    tcpick
    hunt

    Execute the command: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    What do you think it means?
Machine ports are closed
    Why might someone change the value to 1?
Open a port
    You should now install Zenmap
    What command(s) are needed to update and install zenmap?
apt-get update && apt-get install -y zenmap
    Start zenmap

    root does not have permission to run graphics; you'll need to use xhost + from your normal VM user.

    In a terminal type: nmap --top-ports 25 10.4.27.YOURNINJA+1
    What do you see?
    List of open and closed ports.
    Change the 25 to 10 and then to 100 - what changed?
    It shows different views of output.

    Enter the code: nmap -F 10.4.27.1-29

    What did you see?
    Open ports on all computers in that range
    How might this be useful in a digital forensics investigation?
Quickly scan a network of computers

    Scan the subnet to identify the various OSes
    What is an OS?
    Operating Systems
    Why would you scan the network for different OSes?
    To see the diversity of OSes in a room or on a network

    -o is used for OS scans
    What command did you use to scan d22 for different OSes?
    nmap -O 10.4.27.27
    
    What is the address of the printer?
    What is the address of the switch?

    Try the code: nmap --iflist
    What does it do?
    It lists interfaces.
    What are the ipv4 addresses?
    eg 192.168.1.1
    What are the ipv6 addresses?
    eg fe80::a00:27ff:fe40:49c3/64
    Why the difference?
    IPv6 allows for a wider range of IPs to be used.

    Now fire up Zenmap and take a picture of the network topography
    Why would you want a picture of network topography for digital forensics?
In order to preserve the topography of the network during the crime.
