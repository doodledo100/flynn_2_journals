In Kali - type ifconfig What do you see? What is it listing?
It lists the configuration of the network adapters and the IP address and hardware information.
Insert the wireless dongle and pass it through using the virtualbox interface
In Kali - AGAIN - type ifconfig What do you see? What is it listing?
Same as above, except it also lists the wireless adapter information.
What is a 'kernel'?
The kernal is the thing that controls the instructions for loading the OS and is the central core of the OS loading.
How does a kernel relate to the operating system?
It is the central core of the OS loading.
In Kali - type uname -a What does it show and what does it mean?
4.0.0-kali1-amd64; It shows the kernal version.
In Kali use pico to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
Make sure that all of the following entries are listed

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali main non-free contrib
           deb http://security.kali.org/kali-security kali/updates main contrib non-free
           deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali main non-free contrib
           deb-src http://security.kali.org/kali-security kali/updates main contrib non-free
         

Then, run apt-get update
What is the sources.list file for?
It contains a list of all packages in the repositories to be downloaded and installed by the package manager.
In a terminal in Kali - run the command apt-cache search kernel|grep image
What options do you have for kernels? [Summarize the differences]
amd64, Debugging, 64bit, etc; It just has different kernal versions and the one needed just depends on your requirements or compatablitity.
Enter the command apt-get update && apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)
What happened? What is the purpose of this?
It told me it was already installed; It just shows the installation status of a package(s).
After the install is finished - in Kali type shutdown -r now
Remove the wireless dongle
After Kali restarts - type ifconfig and then uname -a
Insert the wireless dongle and pass it through using the virtualbox interface
After Kali AGAIN - type ifconfig
Do you see anything different for ifconfig or uname - either time in comparison to the start values at the beginning of the journal? Describe. [If not - talk to Mr. Davis -- ESPECIALLY BEFORE ENTERING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CODE]
In Kali - enter the following code:

              apt-get install linux-headers-amd64 build-essential git checkinstall
              git clone https://github.com/porjo/mt7601.git
              mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              cd ./mt7601/src
              make
              checkinstall -D make install #answer questions as you like. They don't need answers
              cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              modprobe mt7601Usta
                

Briefly summarize what you just did and why.
Type ifconfig - do you see anything different? Regardless of output - What does that mean?
If nothing has changed - you may need to follow the instruction in README_STA_usb
