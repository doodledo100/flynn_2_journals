In Kali - type ifconfig What do you see? What is it listing?
Insert the wireless dongle and pass it through using the virtualbox interface
In Kali - AGAIN - type ifconfig What do you see? What is it listing?
What is a 'kernel'?
How does a kernel relate to the operating system?
In Kali - type uname -a What does it show and what does it mean?
In Kali use pico to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
Make sure that all of the following entries are listed

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali main non-free contrib
           deb http://security.kali.org/kali-security kali/updates main contrib non-free
           deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali main non-free contrib
           deb-src http://security.kali.org/kali-security kali/updates main contrib non-free
         

Then, run apt-get update
What is the sources.list file for?
In a terminal in Kali - run the command apt-cache search kernel|grep image
What options do you have for kernels? [Summarize the differences]
Enter the command apt-get update && apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)
What happened? What is the purpose of this?
After the install is finished - in Kali type shutdown -r now
Remove the wireless dongle
After Kali restarts - type ifconfig and then uname -a
Insert the wireless dongle and pass it through using the virtualbox interface
After Kali AGAIN - type ifconfig
Do you see anything different for ifconfig or uname - either time in comparison to the start values at the beginning of the journal? Describe. [If not - talk to Mr. Davis -- ESPECIALLY BEFORE ENTERING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CODE]
In Kali - enter the following code:

              apt-get install linux-headers-amd64 build-essential git checkinstall
              git clone https://github.com/porjo/mt7601.git
              mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              cd ./mt7601/src
              make
              checkinstall -D make install #answer questions as you like. They don't need answers
              cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              modprobe mt7601Usta
                

Briefly summarize what you just did and why.
Type ifconfig - do you see anything different? Regardless of output - What does that mean?
If nothing has changed - you may need to follow the instruction in README_STA_usb
