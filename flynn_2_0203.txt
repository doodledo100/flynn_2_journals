    Complete the following:
    In a VM or shared folder (shared folder is better and should be trivial), download the pcap from here
    gunzip the pcap
    In a VM, install tcpdump: apt-get update; apt-get install tcpdump tcpick
    Convert the dump to text with the command: tcpdump -r net-2009-11-13-09\:24.pcap >net2009-11-13.txt
    scroll the the output to get a feel for the communications. [The text file.]
