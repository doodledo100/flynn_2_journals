Looking at the network and hard drive data, briefly describe what happened at these times:

1.    There was an email on Scenario Day 5, November 20.
      Among whom was the email shared? Why is it important?
2.    A certain user had a "hidden" directory? Who? What incriminating pictures were on it? [Names, access times]
3.    Some files named 'patent' aren't. Who created the files? When? On which computer?
4.    Somebody asks about steganography? What is that? who asked? and why? [hypothetically]
5.    Someone downloaded and installed encryption software. Who? when? where?
6.    Someone instructed someone else to delete evidence. Who? Whom?

    Look at the police affidavits:

1.    What is suspected?
2.    How will you use network data to investigate the suspected crime?
3.    Give 3 examples.

----------

The network data is http://digitalcorpora.org/corp/nps/scenarios/2009-m57-patents/net

    Examine the network files

First, make a map of the network topography - label the machines on the subnet

• Is Jo responsible for the files found on the purchased machine? What evidence is there to support this?
• How did this machine get onto the secondary market?
• Who (if anyone) from the company is responsible for the sale of the machine?
• Are there any other suspicious activities occurring within M57?

The case description is http://digitalcorpora.org/corp/nps/scenarios/2009-m57-patents/docs/M57-Patents-Illegal.pdf
