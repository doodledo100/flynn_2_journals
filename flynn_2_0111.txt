Copy the file /usr/share/digitalforensics/images/newfloppy.img to someplace you can work on it.
For each of the following commands, try the command and explain what it does in your words - copying and pasting from man, many of you leave out critical information e.g., such as what it actually does
1. mmls -t dos newfloppy.img - what happens?
 It fails with output "Invalid magic value (File is not a DOS partition (invalid primary magic) (Sector: 0))" because the filesystem type is not 'dos'
2. mmls -t dos manypartitions3.disk
  The command successfully shows the partition layout and disk labels of a disk
3. How is it diferent than newfloppy.img?
It didn't fail because manypartitions is file type 'dos'
4. What is the first column?
The first column is the Sleuth Kit assigned partition id.
5. What might the slot value be?
Describes a partition's location in a volume system table.
6. mmls -t list
This lists the file types that mmls supports:
Supported partition types:
	dos (DOS Partition Table)
	mac (MAC Partition Map)
	bsd (BSD Disk Label)
	sun (Sun Volume Table of Contents (Solaris))
	gpt (GUID Partition Table (EFI))

7. What are raw, aff, afd, afm, afflib, ewf, and split with regards to digital forensics?
raw-This format is a RAW bit-by-bit copy of the original
aff-Advanced Forensic Format is more flexible because it allows extensive metadata to be stored with images, and it also uses less space than other formats.
afd-AFD is a variation of AFF and stores the data and metadata in multiple small files
afm-AFM is another variation of AFF and stores the data in a raw format and the metadata is stored in a separate file
afflib-The Advanced Forensic Format Library and Tools; It is a library of tools that are useful for these disk imaging methods and file types.
ewf-Encase Image File Format aka Expert Witness Format or Eye Witness Format; This file type (*.E01, *.E02) is used in data recovery often.
split-Split raw image file;This process has many different split pieces of an image.
8. Using manypartitions3.disk
9. mmls manypartitions3.disk
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

10. mmls -a manypartitions3.disk
This output only shows allocated volumes:
