How can you recover deleted images?
When a file is 'deleted', it doesn't just disappear into space, its pointer is removed meaning you can't see it but it is still there until it is overwritten  by something else.
These files can be recovered by searching through sectors on the disk.

What information do you need to know?
At least have an idea of what it is you're actually looking for in the data, like in the above example - images. So if you're searching for images on a disk, you may be able to search for image file extensions, etc...
