Why do we use disk images in digital forensics?
We use disk images in order to preserve the physical state of the original drive and contents.
Provide an example and describe a use case.
A criminal uses his computer to delete some ransom notes he thought would be gone forever, but a forensic analyst can recover the data from the drive. Before he starts he should clone the physical drive so if he makes a mistake he can start over with the original copy.

****************************************
What are the steps of creating a blank disk image and then adding files?
In a nutshell:
1. fallocate
2. cfdisk
3. mkfs.ext4
4. kpartx

How does the OSI model relate to the use of disk images?
The Physical layer in the OSI model relates to disk imaging because you are copying the bits and sectors on a physical drive to the disk image file.
